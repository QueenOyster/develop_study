## Summary
A singleton method is a method that is defined only for a particular instance of a class,
providing a way to customize the behavior of individual objects.

1. Singleton Method: A singleton method, also known as an eigenclass method or metaclass method,
                     is a method defined on a specific instance of a class rather than on the class itself.
2. Instance-Level Method: Singleton methods are unique to a particular object instance
                          and cannot be accessed or called by other instances of the same class.
3. Customized Behavior: Singleton methods allow you to define custom behavior or add specific functionality to individual object instances,
                        tailoring their behavior based on specific requirements.
