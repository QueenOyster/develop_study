## Lack of understanding
By creating a symbolic link from dotenv.development.local to .env,
you can access the content of dotenv.development.local through the .env file.
This can be useful, for example,
if you have a specific configuration file for development purposes and
want to use it as .env in your project without modifying the original file.
