## Summary

1. In Ruby on Rails development, an endpoint refers to a specific URL route that maps to a controller action.
2. Endpoints are defined in the application's routes file and specify the URL pattern, HTTP method, and the corresponding controller and action.
3. These endpoints follow RESTful principles, allowing clients to interact with the application's resources through CRUD operations.
   They play a crucial role in defining the application's API surface.
