## What is `force: :cascade` option?
1. The force: :cascade option is used in ActiveRecord's create_table method.
2. It allows for forcefully recreating a table even if it already exists.
3. When used, it deletes the existing table along with its dependent objects (data and constraints) and then creates a new table with the specified name.
